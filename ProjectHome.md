This project is mainly for teaching goal and helps fresh data mining learner understand the Decision Tree better. With data customizing and visual graph features, learners can experiment with their training data and have a quick start with basic decision tree. ID3 is choosen to be the decisiontree generaing algorithm. The algorithm is from the book Data Mining, Concepts and Techniques, Second Edition, which is written by Jiawei Han and published by China Machine PRESS.

Thanks for the SWT and JGraphX project. All contribution to this project is warmly welcome.

本项目主要应用于教学场景，目的在于帮助数据挖掘初学者快速理解决策树。使用者通过自定义各种训练数据生成不同的可视化决策树，能够更直观深入理解决策树的计算过程和结果。决策树生成算法采用了ID3，算法流程来自《数据挖掘：概念与技术（第2版）》一书，作者韩家炜，由机械工业出版社出版。

在此特别感谢SWT和JGraphX项目。欢迎有志之士共同参与开发，继续完善本项目。
